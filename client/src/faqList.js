    question: "What's the purpose of this app?",
    answer: "The purpose of this app is to quickly take note of small loans you've given to your friends, like paying for a beer or buying a concert ticket. Loans that will be paid back within days."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Okay, but what's a real world use case?",
    answer: "You go to a bar with your friends and you get the drinks, whatever they are. Your friends ordered a bunch of shots while you only get a martini. Wouldn't be fair to just split it, huh? So you add the amount you paid for each friends' drinks individually. Then you and your friends repeat this. Next day, all of you see who paid how much, and can settle the uneven balances. "
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "How do I settle my debts?",
    answer: "However you  want. This app helps you track your loans and mark when they're settled, that's all."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Why can't I add 'I owe you's'?",
    answer: "If you can open the app, you might as well just give the money to the person who gave the loan. Or send it via bank transfer. Also, we don't want loans to be duplicated."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Can I remove friends?",
    answer: "Yes, you can. All loans between the two of you will also be removed. So be wise about it."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "Can I remove loans?",
    answer: "Yes, you can remove loans which are owed to you."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Can I settle part of my debts?",
    answer: "No, you can only settle all debts. This app is for micro-loans not long-term debts. If you can't settle them all at once, you probably shouldn't have asked for a loan in the first place."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Can I block people?",
    answer: "Nice try, but no. If someone could add you, you probably let them know your username, probably because you have loans between the two of you. So don't ghost them."
  },  
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Can I add different currencies?",
    answer: "Valid question. Not at the moment, but we plan to add this feature in the future."
  },
